🏫 Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
This project analyzes standardized test score data from New York City public schools to uncover performance trends across boroughs, subjects, and demographics. The aim is to visualize disparities, highlight top-performing schools, and provide insights that could support educational policy or parental decision-making.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes school-level SAT results and related information. Key columns include:

school_name – Name of the public school

borough – NYC borough the school is located in (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn)

average_math – Average SAT Math score

average_reading – Average SAT Reading score

average_writing – Average SAT Writing score

total_SAT – Total score (Math + Reading + Writing)

🎯 Project Goals
Identify top-performing public schools across NYC

Analyze borough-wise performance differences

Examine which schools excel in specific SAT components (Math, Reading, Writing)

Visualize correlations between boroughs and total SAT performance

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python

pandas – for data manipulation and filtering

matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization

DataCamp DataLab – interactive notebook and code environment

📊 Key Insights
Schools with average Math scores above 640 were filtered to identify top performers in quantitative reasoning

A new total_SAT column was created and used to rank schools citywide

The borough with the largest standard deviation in SAT scores was analyzed, revealing performance inequality

Top 10 schools were extracted and visualized for quick comparison
